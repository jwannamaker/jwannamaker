# My name is Johnny Wannamaker.
## I'm graduating with my Mathematics Associate's from Saddleback College, and starting my Bachelor's in Computer Engineering at CSUF!
- I'm currently learning about different serial communication protocols (I2C, UART, SPI) and creating an event driven system based on a Rapsberry Pi and Arduino UNO. 
- I loved taking Linear Algebra and Multivariable Calculus, especially once I started seeing matrix operations in the context of 3D projections when I was manipulating views of 3D models in IsometricRenderer using matplotlib.  
- My project Planector was the result of my experiementions with converting Kepler's Law for planetary motion into an interactive simulation using Pyglet.
