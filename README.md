# Hi, I'm Johnny Wannamaker
## Mathematics A.A. (Saddleback College) --> Computer Engineering B.S. (CSUF)
- I loved taking Linear Algebra and Multivariable Calculus, especially once I started seeing matrix operations in the context of 3D projections when I was manipulating views of 3D models in IsometricRenderer using matplotlib. Computational geometry quickly became an area of interest for me, and I began using video game programming as a way to further explore.
- Video game programming with Python led me to [Pygame](https://pyga.me/docs/index.html), then [Pymunk](https://www.pymunk.org/en/latest/), then [Pyglet](https://pyglet.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), then the [OpenGL](https://pyglet.readthedocs.io/en/latest/programming_guide/gl.html) interface module in Pyglet led me into a deeper dive into graphics programming with C, which led me to [Raylib](https://www.raylib.com/).
- My next projects will be focused on furthering my practice of AI/ML concepts, I'm planning to build an ANN from scratch in C, and utilize OpenGL for visual feedback.
