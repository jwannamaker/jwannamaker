## About me

I loved taking Linear Algebra and Multivariable Calculus at Saddleback, especially once I started seeing matrix operations in the context of 3D projections when I was manipulating views of 3D models in IsometricRenderer using matplotlib. Computational geometry quickly became an area of interest for me, and I began using video game programming as a way to further explore.

Seeking to learn and grow as a software engineer, I learned Python and began programming video games. First, I started with [Pygame](https://pyga.me/docs/index.html), then I integrated the physics engine [Pymunk](https://www.pymunk.org/en/latest/) to a few of my proejcts, and then I switched over to [Pyglet](https://pyglet.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), which is when I started learning about [OpenGL](https://pyglet.readthedocs.io/en/latest/programming_guide/gl.html) through the interface module Pyglet provides. My first time attempting to [Learn OpenGL](https://learnopengl.com/), I gave up after a few days of linker errors, and not being able to draw my first triangle. I went back to using Pyglet, but I never stopped thinking about OpenGL, I knew someday I would have to come back to it.

Once I felt like programming games with C/C++ was the next destination in my journey with video game programming, I came across [Raylib](https://www.raylib.com/) and experiemented with it for a short time. Exactly a year after my first attempt at learning OpenGL, I tried again. This time, I hed a year's worth of programming experience building projects that meant something to me, researching constantly, getting comfortable reading all sorts of documentation... This is where everything in my computer science journey has led me so far --> [LearnOpenGL](github.com/jwannamaker/LearnOpenGL)
