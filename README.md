# Hi, I'm Johnny Wannamaker
## Mathematics A.A. (Saddleback College) --> Computer Engineering B.S. (CSUF)
- I loved taking Linear Algebra and Multivariable Calculus, especially once I started seeing matrix operations in the context of 3D projections when I was manipulating views of 3D models in IsometricRenderer using matplotlib. Computational geometry quickly became an area of interest for me, and I began using video game programming as a way to further explore.
